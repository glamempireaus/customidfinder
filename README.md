# Custom ID Finder
Uses proxy connections + multithreading to check if a list of social media ids are taken. By default, checks steamcommunity.com/id/[word]

This is a proof of concept. It could work with any website.

Requires:

- List of words to use (words.txt)
- List of socks proxy ip:ports (proxies.txt)
