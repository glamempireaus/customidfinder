# Custom ID Finder
uses proxy connections + multithreading to check if a list of social media ids are taken. By default, checks https://steamcommunity.com/id/[id]

this is a proof of concept. Iit could work with any website.

requires:

- list of words to use (words.txt)
- list of socks proxy ip:ports (proxies.txt)
